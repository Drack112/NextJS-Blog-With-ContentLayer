If you are following the Xorg configuration manual, ignore what the manual says about running **_Xorg -configure_**.

**Não execute o Xorg -configure**

If you've already followed the manual and created an xorg.conf, be sure to remove /etc/X11/xorg.conf or /usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf before proceeding:

```shell
rm -f /etc/X11/xorg.conf /usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf
```

## Installing nvidia drivers:

1 - Install x11/nvidia-driver

```shell
pkg install nvidia-driver
```

For some older cards, you need to use x11/nvidia-driver-340 or x11/nvidia-driver-304.

> Check the NVIDIA download page to see which driver version you need. Note that there is no need (and even counterproductive) to download the driver from this page.

2 - Execute

```shell
sysrc kld_list+="nvidia-modeset"
```

To add an entry to /etc/rc.conf to load kernel modules on boot.

**nvidia-modeset** is only available for driver versions >= 358,009, if you use an older version, use `sysrc kld_list+="nvidia"`.

3 - Reboot with `shutdown -r now` or load the required kernel modules now with `kldload nvidia-modeset` or `kldload nvidia`

4 - Create the directory:

```shell
mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
```

5 - Use your text editor in /usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/driver-nvidia.conf with the script below:

```shell
Section "Device"
        Identifier "NVIDIA Card"
        VendorName "NVIDIA Corporation"
        Driver "nvidia"
EndSection
```

6 - Reboot

## Enjoy
