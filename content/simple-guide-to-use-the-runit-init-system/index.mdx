# What's Runit System?

> **runit** is a boot system for Unix-like systems such as Linux. Its main function is to start and manage the processes that are part of the operating system.:

## Why some system's like Void linux use the runit?

- Simplicity: Runit is known for its simplicity and minimalist desig- He focuses on doing the basics and doing them well.

- Managed Processes: Runit is used to start, stop and restart processes on the syste- This includes services, daemons, and other background programs.

- Dependencies: It can handle dependencies between services, which means you can configure it to start services in the correct order, taking into account the dependencies between them.

- Easy Configuration: Runit configuration is generally done through simple directories and scripts, making it accessible even to less experienced system administrators.

- Alternative to Systemd: Some systems prefer runit over systemd, especially those that value simplicity and transparency in initialization and service management.

## How i can use that thing?

- Before uploading a service it is necessary to enable it so that it can be activated at boot time and can be managed by the sv command, to enable a service with runit run:

```bash
$ ln -s /etc/runit/sv/<Name Of Your Service> /run/runit/service
```

## Controlling the service

_Note: When the service is enabled it starts automatically_

```bash
sv start <Name Of Your Service>
```

- To stop him:

```bash
sv stop <Name Of Your Service>
```

- To check its status

```bash
sv status <Name Of Your Service>
```

- To restart it

```bash
sv restart <Name Of Your Service>
```

## Disabling service at boot

- To disable access at boot simply create a file called \*down\* in the program folder in question, example:

```bash
 touch /etc/runit/sv/<Name Of Your Service>/down
```

## Monitoring the system

- View the status of all services

```bash
sv status /var/service/*
```

## Seeing boot tree

> First install the tree command from your package manager and then

```bash
tree /etc/runit/sv/servicedir
```

You will see output similar to:

```bash
 servicedir
 ├── run (755)
 ├── check (755)
 ├── conf (644)
 ├── finish (755)
 └── log (directory)
     ├── config (644)
     └── run (755)
```
