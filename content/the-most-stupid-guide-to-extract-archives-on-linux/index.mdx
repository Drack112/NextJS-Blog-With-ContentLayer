## Just like any other system in Linux, it is possible to extract rar, zip and other files through a graphical interface. But if you are someone who prefers the old Terminal, here is the list of commands on how to extract these files via terminal.

### Files that are listed

- Rar
- Zip
- Tar
- Tar.gz
- bz2
- Tar.bz2

## Extracting these files

Now follow the commands to be carried out in the terminal and I was able to extract it.

#### Zip

```bash
$ unzip filename.zip
```

#### Rar

```bash
$ unrar x filename.rar
```

#### Tar

```bash
$ tar -xvf filename.tar
```

#### Tar.gz

```bash
$ $tar -vzxf filename.tar.gz
```

#### Bz2

```bash
$ bunzip filename.bz2
```

#### Tar.bz2

```bash
$ tar -jxvf filename.tar.bz2
```
